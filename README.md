# Blazor Filestack Application
Blazor Filestack usage, policy and signatures generation. 
File uploading with filestack in blazor application. 
Upload files with basic authentication or using policy.

This project is helpfull to use filestack in asp.net, asp.net mvc, asp.net core to generate policy/signatures on server side code and to provide it in application dynamically.
So if you are going to use javascript version of filestack or looking to make calls to File-API of filestack, you would love to use this for authentication process either basic authentication or policy based authentication.

This is also helpfull for blazor applications, you can see how i am using this into blazor to use File Uploader, File Browser to access file and Basic Authentication Process.
